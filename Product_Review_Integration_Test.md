# Product Review Integration Test

## Test Data Available
Based on your database data:
```
ProductReview ID: 9
ProductId: 55
UserId: 31
CustomerEmail: vudangdiapolos@gmail.com
Rating: 5
Comment: okee  
Status: approved
Created: 2025-09-28 09:13:12.273
```

## Test API Calls

### 1. Get Product with Reviews (Should now show rating & reviewCount)
```bash
GET /api/v1/product/id/55
```

**Expected Response Enhancement:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 55,
    "name": "Product Name",
    "rating": 5.0,           // ← NEW: Should show 5.0 instead of 0
    "reviewCount": 1,        // ← NEW: Should show 1 instead of 0
    "viewCount": 0,
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

### 2. Test Product Reviews Endpoint (if exists)
```bash
GET /api/v1/productreview/product/55
```

### 3. Test Get All Products (List view - should also show ratings)
```bash
GET /api/v1/product?page=1&size=10
```

## Database Verification

**Check ProductReviews Table:**
```sql
SELECT Id, ProductId, UserId, Rating, Comment, Status, CreatedAt 
FROM ProductReviews 
WHERE ProductId = 55 AND Status = 'approved'
```

**Verify Product exists:**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, IsActive 
FROM Products 
WHERE Id = 55
```

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. ProductRepo Updates:
- ✅ Added `.Include(c => c.ProductReviews.Where(r => r.Status == "approved"))` to GetByIdAsync
- ✅ Added same include to GetBySlugAsync  
- ✅ Only loads approved reviews for performance and data integrity

### 2. ProductService Updates:
- ✅ Added `CalculateAverageRating()` method
- ✅ Added `CountApprovedReviews()` method
- ✅ Updated MapToDto to use these calculations instead of hardcoded 0 values

### 3. Rating Calculation Logic:
- ✅ Filters for approved reviews only
- ✅ Excludes reviews with rating = 0  
- ✅ Returns 0 if no valid reviews found
- ✅ Rounds average to 1 decimal place (e.g., 4.3)

### 4. Review Count Logic:
- ✅ Counts only approved reviews
- ✅ Returns 0 if no reviews found
- ✅ Excludes pending/rejected reviews

## Expected Results

**For Product ID 55:**
- `rating`: 5.0 (from the single 5-star review)
- `reviewCount`: 1 (one approved review)
- Database shows status='approved' so it should be included

## Debugging Steps if Issues

1. **Check if ProductReviews are loaded:**
   - Add logging in ProductService.MapToDto
   - Log: `product.ProductReviews?.Count()` 

2. **Verify review status:**
   - Ensure status is exactly "approved" (case-sensitive)
   - Check for any whitespace issues

3. **Test calculation methods directly:**
   - Add unit tests for CalculateAverageRating
   - Add unit tests for CountApprovedReviews

The rating and review count should now appear correctly in API responses! 🎉
